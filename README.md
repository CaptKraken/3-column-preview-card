## My process

Started out with HTML then went the desktop-first route. After that, started modifying things to fix the problems.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [This Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31000885/align-an-element-to-bottom-with-flexbox) - This helped me keep the buttons at the bottom of the card all the times.
